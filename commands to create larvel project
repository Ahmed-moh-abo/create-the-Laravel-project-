Now we will create a Laravel project in Xampp folder. First we need to move to the xampp folder where we create a new laravel project.
cd c:
cd xampp/htdocs/
In the above screen, cd c: command is used to move to the c drive and then we use the command cd xampp/htdocs/ to move to the xampp folder.
---
First, we use the ls command to view the list of projects.
it shows that list is empty, i.e., no projects are available in the xampp folder. Now, we first clear the screen, and create a new laravel project.

Create a new laravel project.
we use the command "composer create-project laravel/laravel firstproject".
where,
laravel/laravel: It is a vendor package.
firstproject: It is a project name.
-----
We can also use below commands to create a new laravel project:

composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/laravel project_name 
composer create-project laravel/laravel project_name --prefer-dist
